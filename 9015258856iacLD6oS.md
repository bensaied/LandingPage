## Challenge: Landing Page + WordPress API Based Plugin

  

As part of the application process, you have been asked to complete the following challenge. If you have any questions, please let us know in the provided TeamTailor email thread.

  

## Overview

  

You will create a simple landing page based on the provided design and a basic WordPress plugin that sets up a REST endpoint for a contact form submission on the WordPress site where your plugin is activated.

  

## Landing Page

  

#### Specifications:

  

*   Develop the landing page using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) following our [](https://www.figma.com/file/vJ108hRrMKjSNoh9g46M4Z/Developer's-task?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=rdbzQ0AuMd9aE35a-1).
*   Avoid using any markup or CSS frameworks (such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc).
*   Use modern markup and styling techniques.
*   Ensure that the website is fully responsive by adjusting elements for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
*   The featured video will play the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXb3EKWsInQ) when the play button is clicked, and the 4 grid card following the featured video will be animated. The method of implementation is at your discretion!
*   Connect the contact form to the custom endpoint created in the WordPress API Based Plugin task.

  

## WordPress API Based Plugin

  

#### Specifications:

  

*   Create a custom post type named `Form` in the WordPress website, containing email and message custom fields.
*   Create a REST API endpoint in the WordPress site under `{your_name}/v1/contact-form`. This endpoint should only be accessible via POST HTTP Method and accept POST Parameters name, email, and message.
*   Save the form details to the custom post type `Form` . Name should be saved as the title of the CPT, while email and message should be saved as custom meta fields. If a new form submission with the same email is received within 1 hour, return an error.
*   In your Landing Page task, use the created endpoint in your WordPress website to submit contact form submissions.

  

#### Notes:

  

*   Your submission must be a fully functional WordPress plugin that meets the specified requirements.
*   Use modern PHP approaches/architecture (e.g., OOP, autoloading, PSR4, Composer, etc).
*   Ensure proper data escaping, sanitization, and validation using built-in PHP and WordPress functions.
*   Make all user-facing text translatable.
*   The code should not be derived from any boilerplate.

  

## Heads up!

  

*   Use your name as the root folder name of the project. The landing page should be located under the `web` folder, and the WordPress plugin under the `server` folder.
*   Include all development resources (`.git` files, `webpack.config.js`, `.eslintrc.json`, `composer.json`, `package.json`, etc., if applicable).
*   Include a readme file in the main folder of the project that gives a brief explanation of your challenge project and instructions on how to install and run it on your local machine.
